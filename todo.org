#+title: Todo
* [ ] Add language to symbol and use it find parser when generating a summary
* [X] Fix python decorators to be included in raw symbol output
* [X] Implement recursive parsing function. Do not parse the file if it's hash did not change.
* [ ] Add data access helper that reads file from data store along with all symbols
* [ ] Add a helper to resolve import edge dependencies
* [-] Need to delete files, packages, symbols, etc that are no longer exist on the disk
* [X] Create helper methods to return models from parser objects
* [X] Fix _resolve_to_package_id to use data repository
* [ ] Add git support
** [ ]  Use git to quickly find what files have changed
* [ ] Expose a helper method in Project class to calculate embedding for the arbitrary search term
* [ ] Better in-memory vector index (pandas?)
* [ ] Create a helper that generates a summary view of a file
* [ ] OpenAI-compatible tool definition support
* [ ] MCP-compatible tool definition support
* [ ] Tools
** [ ] File list
- List of directories, recursive or not
- Flag to include docstrings
- Flag to include AGENT.md files
- Token limit
** [ ] Summary lists
- Takes a list of file paths or packages
- Returns summary views of files
- Token limit
** [ ] Get files
- A list of files
** [ ] Search through symbols
- Needle
- Result list
- Token limit
** [ ] Search symbol by name
- Path prefixes (optional)
* [ ] Figure out a way to update embeddings in background
* [ ] Add embedding value caching
** [ ] A shared cross-project table
** [ ] A server with simple API to insert embedding value for a hash and get multiple embedding values for a hash
* [ ] Do not warn on pass_statement
* [ ] Add support for del_statement?
* [ ] Add support for FTS when embedding search is not feasible
* [ ] Even if file can not be parsed, store information about it in the database
